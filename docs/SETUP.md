# Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project for the first time:

1. Install the vscode-esp-idf extension (skip this if you already have it installed)
2. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run "ESP-IDF: Configure ESP-IDF extension" (skip this if you have already done it)
3. Follow the prompts to set up the ESP-IDF environment
4. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run "Add VS Code Configuration Folder" to setup the .vscode folder. It is not included in the repository.
5. Checkout the submodules (Bosh BMP3 driver) by running `git submodule update --init --recursive`
